**Harnessing Microbiomes to Enhance Biological Processes**
---

<h3 align="justify">Scientific Background: </h3>

 <p align="justify">
I'm a microbiologist, specialized in microbial ecology and bioinformatics. I received my PhD from the Complutense University of Madrid in October 2022, later that year I started my postdoctoral fellowship within the Sustainable Agriculture and Biogeochemistry Group at ICA-CSIC. Even though my whole scientific background is focused on harnessing microbiomes to enhance biological processes, I could divide my work according to the studied ecosystem:
   
- The study of microbial communities, and its interactions, in membrane bioreactors and the development of tools that inhibit the _quorum sensing_ systems that promote biofilm formation in the surface of membranes.

- Yeast community composition and succession during wine fermentations.

- Microbiomes associated with major crop wild progenitors.
