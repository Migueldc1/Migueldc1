 I'm a microbiologist, specialized in microbial ecology and bioinformatics. My career started in the [MINE lab](http://minelab.bioucm.es/) at Complutense University of Madrid, where I received my PhD in October 2022, later that year I started a postdoctoral fellowship within the Sustainable Agriculture and Biogeochemistry Group at ICA-CSIC.

<h2 align="justify">Harnessing Microbiomes to Enhance Biological Processes</h2>

<div align="justify">

 Microorganisms have been exploited for millennia for biotechnological purposes, from traditional food production to today's biofactories. Many of these processes are not carried out by a single species, but by complex communities of microorganisms, where it is difficult to identify the relationship between their taxonomic composition and the functions they perform. The functions of these ecosystems emerge from the individual contributions of each member and their ecological interactions. It is in this context my work was developed through all my research stages. Initially, I employed classical microbiology techniques to isolate strains with enhanced properties. Subsequently, my focus shifted to microbial ecology, exploring how microbial communities can be strategically harnessed. To deepen my understanding, I started training in bioinformatic analysis, acquiring proficiency in multivariate statistics and R. Additionally, I further studied the transcriptomic profiles of specific strains and communities, gaining a comprehensive assessment of their functional potential under distinct conditions. I could divide my research according to the studied system.

The MICROWILD network aims to address how domestication has changed the plant microbiome of major crops for global agriculture. This knowledge is needed to optimize the interactions between plants and microbial communities occurring in the rhizosphere, which is crucial to increase global food production and its resilience to climate change. To do that, we are coordinating an international consortium sampling the wild progenitors of ten crops in their native sites of distribution in the Fertile Crescent, Meso and South America, the Sahel, and South East Asia.

Restoring the microbiome of wild progenitors in modern crops is a promising strategy to address major agricultural challenges such as food security, sustainability, global change adaptation and preservation of soil biodiversity and health. Contrary to the widespread assumption that crop wild progenitors tend to occur in marginal environments, our research reveals thriving presence in four markedly different edaphoclimatic ecoregions, ranging from deserts to tropical seasonal forest and savanna. Additionally, we identified a soil core microbiome organized into ecological groups of microbial taxa with variations in their lifestyles and prevalence across the ecoregions. We found that the assembly of the soil core microbiome was partially driven by environmental factors, yet the influence of wild progenitor identities was stronger. These findings are novel since most scientific studies to date addressing the microbiome of crop wild progenitors do not prospect at their native environments. Linking the ecoregions of crop wild progenitors with their associated microbiome will help to evaluate the domestication and cultivation impacts on crop microbiome composition and guide microbial-assisted agriculture.

  We are a research group interested in understanding how microbial communities drives industrial microbial-based processes. Applying a microbial ecology perspective, we aim to understand the individual role of key microbial species in anthropogenic ecosystems (i.e. wine fermentations and wastewater treatment plants) and their interaction within the whole community and the environment
